## Game Rules

"Guess the Undercover" follows these basic rules:

- **Word Assignment:** At the start of the game, each player receives a word. Most players receive the same word (normal players), but the undercover(s) receive a different word that is similar but not identical.
  
- **Description:** Players take turns describing their word without revealing it directly. The aim is to be vague enough to avoid being identified by the undercover but clear enough to prove you're a normal player.
  
- **Voting:** After each round of descriptions, players vote on who they believe is the undercover. The player with the most votes is eliminated.
  
- **Winning the Game:** The game ends when the undercover(s) are eliminated, or when the number of undercovers equals or exceeds the number of normal players.
